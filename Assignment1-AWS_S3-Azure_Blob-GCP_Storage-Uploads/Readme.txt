Homework 1.
I mainly used to the GUI on the websites to upload stuff to the object store and
create the tables and stuff. I tried to do scripts but I had a really hard time doing
the connections through python. Since the homework assignment was ambiguous if we needed
the scripts I just have screenshots of the nosql tables with the logo links in the object store.

Here are links to the logos in the cloud!
