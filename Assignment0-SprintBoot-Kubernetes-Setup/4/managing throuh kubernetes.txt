For some reason kubectl is ignoring my hyper-v requests to use my newly created virtual switches.
I have no idea why its so agreesivly saying "Skipping virtual_switch driver" existing host has virtualbox driver.
I don't have virtualbox installed???????? what the heck


C:\Users\samyu>minikube start --vm-driver hyperv--hyperv-virtual-switch "Primary Virtual Switch"
Starting local Kubernetes v1.13.2 cluster...
Starting VM...
Skipping hyperv--hyperv-virtual-switch driver, existing host has virtualbox driver.

 Retrying.
